# JW Meeting display

This is a basic application for displaying books & magazines in epub format from the jw website in congregation meetings. If you have any issues or feature requests please add them in the issues section.

*Please note: Upon downloading the application you may get a warning about the file being dangerous, please bypass this warning it's simply because it hasnt been code signed. As long as you download the application directly from github the application will be virus free, I hope to fix this soon...*
